        Physics is the study of matter, energy, and the interactions between them.
        It forms the foundation for understanding how the universe works—from
        everyday objects to cosmic phenomena.
    </p>
    <p><strong>1. What is Physics?</strong><br>
        Physics explains how and why objects move, how forces act on matter,
        and how energy is transferred.
    </p>
    <p><strong>2. Key Concepts</strong><br>
        <strong>Force:</strong> A push or pull that changes motion.<br>
        <strong>Motion:</strong> Speed, direction, and acceleration.<br>
        <strong>Energy:</strong> The ability to do work.<br>
        <strong>Gravity:</strong> The attraction between masses.
    </p>
    <p><strong>3. Newton’s Laws of Motion</strong><br>
        <strong>First Law:</strong> Objects remain at rest or in motion unless acted upon.<br>
        <strong>Second Law:</strong> Force equals mass times acceleration (F = ma).<br>
        <strong>Third Law:</strong> Every action has an equal and opposite reaction.
    </p>
    <p><strong>4. Why Physics Matters</strong><br>
        Physics plays a crucial role in technology, transportation, medicine,
        and understanding natural phenomena.

            opens the door to understanding the world around us.”
