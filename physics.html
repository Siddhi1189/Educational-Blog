    <b>The Basics of Physics: An Introduction</b>

Physics is the study of matter, energy, and the interactions between them. It's the foundation of how everything in the universe works—from the smallest particles to the largest galaxies. If you're new to the subject, here’s a quick overview of its fundamental concepts.<br><br>

<p><b>1. What is Physics?</b>
Physics is all about understanding how and why things move, how forces work, and how energy is transferred. It helps explain the forces of nature and how objects behave.<br><br>
</p>
<p1><b>2. Key Concepts</b><br>
<b>Force:</b> A push or pull that can change an object’s motion.<br>
<b>Motion:</b> How objects move in terms of speed, direction, and acceleration.<br>
<b>Energy:</b> The ability to do work, existing in forms like kinetic (motion) and potential (stored) energy.<br>
<b>Gravity:</b> The force that pulls objects toward the Earth (or any other massive body).<br><br>
</p1>
<p2><b>3. Newton’s Laws of Motion</b><br>
<b>First Law (Inertia):</b> Objects stay in motion or at rest unless acted upon by a force.<br>
<b>Second Law:</b> Force equals mass times acceleration (F = ma).<br>
<b>Third Law:</b> For every action, there’s an equal and opposite reaction.<br><br>
</p2>
<p3><b>4. Why It Matters</b><br>
<b>Physics is everywhere:</b> it powers the technology we use, explains how planets orbit, and even helps us understand how light travels. Whether in transportation, medicine, or daily life, physics helps us make sense of the world.<br><br>
