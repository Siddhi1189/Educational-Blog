        Mathematics can be a challenging subject for many students, but with the right approach,
        anyone can excel in it. Whether you're struggling with basic arithmetic or tackling
        advanced calculus, the following strategies will help.
    </p>
    <p><strong>1. Start with the Basics</strong><br>
    Mathematics is cumulative. Master foundational concepts before moving forward.</p>

    <p><strong>2. Practice Regularly</strong><br>
    Consistent daily practice improves understanding and confidence.</p>

    <p><strong>3. Understand the “Why”</strong><br>
    Focus on understanding formulas instead of memorizing them.</p>

    <p><strong>4. Break Problems Into Steps</strong><br>
    Smaller steps make complex problems manageable.</p>

    <p><strong>5. Use Visual Aids</strong><br>
    Diagrams and graphs help clarify abstract concepts.</p>

    <p><strong>6. Seek Help</strong><br>
    Ask teachers, peers, or use online resources when stuck.</p>

    <p><strong>7. Use Online Tools</strong><br>
    Platforms like Khan Academy and Wolfram Alpha are valuable.</p>

    <p><strong>8. Stay Positive</strong><br>
    Patience and consistency are key to success.</p>

    <p><strong>9. Review Regularly</strong><br>
    Weekly revision strengthens long-term retention.</p>
